<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonathan</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies off all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Expendables</h3>
<p>
  I really like this film, because it is a war genre and the actors are very
  cool when performing their roles.
</p>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>
  This film tells the story of a family who live as they are, who then enter one
  by one and work in a wealthy family, creating a very dramatic chaotic
  atmosphere.
</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
  Since I was in elementary school, I really like watching Naruto anime films,
  because there are many things that can be taken from the film, starting from
  friendship, sacrifice, struggle and many more.
